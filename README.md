# Immers App
Tools to deploy your own Immers Space destination in the federated metaverse.

There are two parts that make up an immer.
1. Your Immersive Web experience.
Immers Space is designed to work across platforms and engines with any experience.
2. The immers social networking server.
This is what connects your experience with the metaverse and allows immersers from other immers to bring their identity, avatars, and friends to your destination.

There are two sets of tools and instructions here to choose from depending on your Immersive Web experience.

## I have a custom Immersive Web Experience

[Go to the immers folder for tools to deploy just the immers server](./immers)

## I want to use Immers Space with Mozilla Hubs Cloud

[Go to the immers-hubs folder for tools to deploy the immers server and integrate with Hubs](./immers-hubs)
